# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I was motivated to build this project in order to help learn the basics to building a webpage. I built this prework study guide webpage to store all my notes and useful information that I have learned during the bootcamp prework. Building this webpage helped me learn HOW to build a webpage, step by step. I have learned the very basics of CSS, JavaScript, and HTML. I have also become familiar with the basics of GitHub, VSCode, and Git Bash.
